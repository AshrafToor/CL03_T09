        <p>This website gives important information about cancer mortality in OECD nations. There are four primary 
        aspects to our platform. The first aspect displays gender-specific cancer death rates for 2017 and 2021.
        The second aspect of this website shows expected cancer death rates in coming years till 2050. 
        The third aspect covers the main cancer types by gender in 2017, 2019 and 2021. The 
        strategies for preventing cancer are also provided. Our mission is to provide easily 
        available and useful information to the users. Our goal is to enhance global health outcomes by promoting informed 
        decision-making through an understanding of cancer patterns and prevention techniques.</p>
